<h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a separate pot, heat the vegetable broth and keep it warm on low heat.</li>
        <li>In a large pan or skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add finely chopped onion and saut√© until softened.</li>
        <li>Add Arborio rice to the pan and toast it for a couple of minutes, stirring to coat the rice evenly with the oil and butter.</li>
        <li>Pour in white wine and stir until the wine is mostly absorbed by the rice.</li>
        <li>Begin adding the warm broth to the rice one ladle at a time. Stir frequently and allow the liquid to be absorbed before adding more. Continue this process until the rice is creamy and cooked to an al dente texture.</li>
        <li>Add diced pumpkin to the risotto when it's about halfway cooked. Continue adding broth and stirring until the rice is creamy, and the pumpkin is tender.</li>
        <li>Stir in grated Parmesan cheese and butter.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve the Pumpkin Risotto hot, garnished with extra Parmesan if desired.</li>
