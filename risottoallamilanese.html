    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, soak the saffron threads in a few tablespoons of warm water to release their flavor and color. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate pot, heat the beef broth and keep it warm on low heat.</li>
        <li>In a large pan or skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion and saut√© until it becomes translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the Arborio rice to the pan and toast it for a couple of minutes, stirring to coat the rice evenly with the oil.</li>
        <li>Pour in the white wine and stir until the wine is mostly absorbed by the rice.</li>
        <li>Begin adding the warm broth to the rice one ladle at a time. Stir frequently and allow the liquid to be absorbed before adding more. Continue this process until the rice is creamy and cooked to an al dente texture.</li>
        <li>About halfway through the cooking process, add the saffron-infused water to the risotto, ensuring even distribution of the saffron throughout the dish.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is cooked, stir in the remaining butter and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Serve the Risotto alla Milanese hot, garnished with additional Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
